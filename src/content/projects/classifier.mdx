# üêæ Problem Statement

In many contexts‚Äîsuch as animal shelters, smart surveillance systems, or educational tools‚Äîautomatically identifying whether an animal is a cat or a dog from images or a live webcam feed can be both useful and challenging. Manually labeling images is inefficient and prone to human error, especially when working with large datasets or real-time video.

<br />

# üí° Solution

To address this, we built a **real-time image classification system** capable of distinguishing between dogs and cats using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **TensorFlow**. The system processes input either from static images or a live webcam stream, and instantly classifies the detected object as either a dog or a cat.

Using **Python** and **TensorFlow**, we trained a CNN on a dataset of labeled dog and cat images. The model extracts and learns spatial hierarchies of features from the input images, improving its accuracy in distinguishing subtle differences between the two classes.

Once trained, the model was exported and integrated into a lightweight web application using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, allowing users to upload images or use their webcam directly from a browser. This frontend communicates with the model via TensorFlow.js or a backend Python API, enabling predictions in real time.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** ‚Äì for model training, preprocessing, and export
- **TensorFlow** ‚Äì for building and training the CNN
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** ‚Äì core architecture for image classification
- **HTML + CSS** ‚Äì for building the web interface
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì for handling frontend interactivity and webcam integration

<br />

# üöÄ Highlights

- Real-time classification using a webcam
- Lightweight and responsive frontend UI
- Custom-trained CNN model with TensorFlow
- End-to-end integration of machine learning with a web interface
